### Where I'm From 
![Florida](http://www.worldatlas.com/img/areamap/703c198db6b9235a043ab7b56a6dc743.gif)  
Conveniently located just about an hour away from both Disneyland and the beach. **super hot**, and filled with gators, but at least we've got the water. 



### What I study 
![Biology](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7fe4e3_e9631d35de724b12b75a50f50d0c76fd~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_60,w_395,h_275/fill/w_551,h_385,al_c,lg_1,q_80/Biology.jpg)  
Studying Biology at George Washington University, located in the beautiful city of Washington D.C. Where else are you going to be able to go to school and live only 3 blocks away from the white house and monuments? 

### Camp
![Camp](https://secure2.convio.net/hwgf/teamraiser-themes/general/images/hole-logo.png)  
The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp was founded by Paul Newman in 1988, serving children with life threatening or serious ilnesses. Providing an environment dedicated to providing “a different kind of healing” to seriously ill children and their families, free of charge. It is a community that celebrates the spirit of childhood, the sound of laughter and the feeling of endless possibility. You can find out more [here](https://www.holeinthewallgang.org/about/).
